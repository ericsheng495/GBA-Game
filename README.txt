1) Game Overview:
	The objective for the player (red square) is to hit as many obstacles (blue) as possible. The player spawns at the top right corner of the screen. And an obstacle will appear randomly on the screen. The player can use up,down,right, and left arrows to control the red square to move.

	Everytime the player comes in contact with the obstacle, the obstacle will respawn in another location on the screen (note that there will be at most one obstacle on the screen) and the player earns a point. The player's score is displayed at bottom left corner of the screen within the "score region". The score region is below the yellow line. The player can move freely across the game boundary, which is enclosed within the top of the screen, the left of the screen, the right of the screen and the score region. In other words, both the player and the obstacle will not be able to go below the yellow line (score region). 

	A player "wins" if his or her total score is greater than 5 (hitting at least 6 obstacles). And a player "loses" if the total score is below 6.
